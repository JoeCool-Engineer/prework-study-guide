# Prework-Study-Guide README

## Description

In my lifetime I've had a number of careers and have had a number of learning oppurtunities. I've amassed a substantial collection of notebooks by which it's becoming harder to manage and track. The purpose of the Prework-Study-Guide is two fold; to better maintain and track my lessons learned, to reduce the consumption of paper and access from anywhere in the world. 

This website is the collections of my notes as I cover the Fullstack bootcamp and possibly all other courses taken this far.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

## Badges
First attempt at a static badge :smiley

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
